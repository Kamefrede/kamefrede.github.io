Three words: <strong>fear of failure</strong>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m afraid of failing, afraid of taking risks, afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone, afraid of asking for help, afraid of looking incompetent in the eyes of others.</p><p>When faced with a roadblock, instead of relying on others for help, I will just try and bash my head against the problem, trying variations of the same thing again and again, all the while growing increasingly more frustrated calling myself a failure, a disappointment, a worthless person, a sad excuse of a man, that in comparison to person X I&rsquo;m nothing since they would have been able to figure it out by now.</p><p>I relentlessly beat myself up time and time again.</p><p>To avoid the my own mental torture, I dissuade myself from decisions that can carry even a slight amount of risk. Which means that once I get comfortable with something, I will remain there forever, never improving, never learning anything new, but always hoping that by some miracle I will spontaneously become better at that something, without having to expose myself to the potential risk that comes with embetterment.</p><p>This destructive behaviour has caused me to stagnate in terms of my skills, to miss opportunities that could have radically changed the course of my life.</p><p>Dear reader, this is where I wish I could put a simple walkthrough of how to get rid of this behaviour, to be able to help those who are in a situation similar to mine.<br>But, the truth is, I have no idea how as I am still on the long journey of figuring it out, with the help of a mental health professional, and have only now gotten the courage to publicly admit that I am in fact not okay.<br>However, I do leave you with this tiny piece of wisdom: If you don&rsquo;t feel comfortable or cannot afford a it, while not a substitute for it, there are free and anonymous mental health hotlines that have trained counselors that can listen to you such as <a href=https://giveusashout.org/>Shout</a> in the UK or <a href=https://www.crisistextline.org/>Crisis</a> in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Ireland.</p><p>Thank you for reading,<br>Emanuel &ldquo;Kamefrede&rdquo; Ferraz</p></content><p><a href=http://kamefrede.xyz/blog/2022/>#2022</a>
