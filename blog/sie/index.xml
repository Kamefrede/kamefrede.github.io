&lt;p&gt;The reason for that? Three words: &lt;strong&gt;fear of failure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of failing, afraid of taking risks, afraid of stepping out of my comfort zone, afraid of asking for help, afraid of looking incompetent in the eyes of others.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stuff I Enjoy: Minecraft</title><link>http://kamefrede.xyz/stuff-i-enjoy-minecraft/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Apr 2021 13:35:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kamefrede.xyz/stuff-i-enjoy-minecraft/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first installment of Stuff I Enjoy! I was going to postpone this to next week but decided against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This installment is dedicated to Minecraft, a game that shaped my entire youth. I started playing Minecraft in 2011, around the time that Beta 1.7.3 dropped. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until Beta 1.8 that I actually started getting more into it.
Why? When I first booted it up, I created a survival world but didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to break blocks. I was trying to get wood by spam clicking it instead of holding the mouse button. Which, in hindsight, doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense at all, but younger me thought it was the way to do it and was so confused that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working to the point of closing the game in a fit of anger.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Do I Like</title><link>http://kamefrede.xyz/what-do-i-like/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 14:59:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://kamefrede.xyz/what-do-i-like/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get into writing more. My friends Adrian, Alwinfy, and Willie encouraged me to start writing blog posts as it would be a decent way to get started. I thought about it for a while and concluded that they were right. Taking up blogging would be nice. But then, I ran into my first blocker. What would I write?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to do some online searching about it, as it was unlikely that I was the only person who didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to blog.
The answer that showed up pretty much everywhere was to write about what you like. I gave it a lot of thought, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with anything. At this point, you, the reader, might be thinking, how is it possible that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he likes?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
