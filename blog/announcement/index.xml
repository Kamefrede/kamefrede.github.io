My friends Adrian, Alwinfy, and Willie encouraged me to start writing blog posts as it would be a decent way to get started. I thought about it for a while and concluded that they were right. Taking up blogging would be nice. But then, I ran into my first blocker. What would I write?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My first instinct was to do some online searching about it, as it was unlikely that I was the only person who didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to blog.
The answer that showed up pretty much everywhere was to write about what you like. I gave it a lot of thought, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with anything. At this point, you, the reader, might be thinking, how is it possible that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he likes?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
