Hi!
My name is Emanuel Ferraz, better known on the internet as Kamefrede. I&rsquo;m a software developer from Gondomar, Portugal.
What kind of software do you develop? In my day job, I mostly maintain legacy codebases(mostly C# and JS) and develop tailor-made software for various different clients(factories, restaurants, etc..).
In my spare time, I mostly do Minecraft modding in both Java and Kotlin(I was going to try Clojure, but it was too much of a pain to get it to work)."><meta name=keywords content><link rel=icon href="data:;base64,iVBORw0KGgo="><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="Who am I?

I’m a bit rusty since I mainly used to practice and play in a Folklore group but due to COVID, there haven&rsquo;t been any recent meetings. :(</p><h2 id=whats-the-origin-of-your-name>What&rsquo;s the origin of your name?</h2><p>This is too long of a story to cover here and so it will get a dedicated post.</p></content><p></p></main><footer><a href=https://twitter.com/Kamefrede>Twitter</a>
