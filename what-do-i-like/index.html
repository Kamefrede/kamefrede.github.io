The answer that showed up pretty much everywhere was to write about what you like. I gave it a lot of thought, but I couldn&rsquo;t come up with anything. At this point, you, the reader, might be thinking, how is it possible that he doesn&rsquo;t know what he likes?</p><p>Well, dear reader, the answer is simple. For me, liking something is much more than just enjoying it. You have to miss it, always wanting to come back for more. While in the dictionary, enjoying and liking might be synonyms, they carry different meanings to me.</p><p>I enjoy a lot of stuff: gaming, programming, and music(both playing and listening), to name a few. But, I have no real attachment to them. I can easily replace them with something else if I grow tired of them. Often this happens as I get spurts of motivation to do something and then completely neglect to do it for a long time.</p><p>With this in mind, I decided to start a new mini-series called Stuff I Enjoy. It&rsquo;s a way for me to celebrate activities that at the time of writing I enjoyed doing, and in the future to be able to look back at them and reminisce.</p><p>(This is my take on my friend <a href=https://www.vincent-lee.net/til_ranks/>Williewillus' blog series Things I like</a>)</p></content><p><a href=http://kamefrede.xyz/blog/sie/>#sie</a>
